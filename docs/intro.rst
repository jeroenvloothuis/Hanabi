Intro to Hanabi
===============

Hanbi is a framework build with several goals in mind.

Make efficient use of limited resources
---------------------------------------

Hanabi is designed to get the most out of a the hardware you have. Whether this
is a small VPS or a high end dedicated server.


Include common infrastructure
-----------------------------

A developer should only need to write the code that is specific to their
application. To make this as little code as possible Hanabi provides a lot of
things out of the box.


Do the right thing without configuration
----------------------------------------

All of the built-in infrastructure makes it easy for you to build an app. It
also makes it easy to do it right. This includes bundling of static resources,
caching etc.

Strong conventions
------------------

Having strong conventions makes a lot of things simpler. Strong conventions
make it easy to know what goes where in a project and how things are done. This
even makes it easier to automate several tasks.

Eliminating choice also alleviates choice paralysis.
